**Project Description:**  
The **WorkManager Library** is part of Android Jetpack, designed to simplify and streamline background task management in Android apps. It provides a unified API for scheduling deferrable, one-off, or recurring tasks that require guaranteed execution, even if the app exits or the device restarts. Ideal for tasks like syncing data, uploading logs, or sending notifications, WorkManager ensures reliability and efficiency while optimizing battery life.
